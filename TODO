Testing 

ls
- list out everything with highest priority first
- list out only specfici priorities
- list done as well

Cobra 
- learn flags 

example command:
to list out all of the locations 
instead of `lsc` maybe `ls -l` 

Functionality I want to add 
Adding projects as well as location.
A project would have a tag and split from location.
So a location would have "@home" and it would list all things @home
but different projects @home
like:

finish painting room @home +paint
make sure to wash paint off brushes @home +paint

clean fridge @home +cleaning
wash dishes @home +cleaning

That way I could further parse out tasks @home into their own project

But I wouldn't need to give something it's own project if it's a one off task

I'm thinking learning Cobra flags will be good with this..
