Testing 

ls
- list out everything with highest priority first
- list out only specfici priorities
- list done as well

Cobra 
- learn flags 

example command:
to list out all of the locations 
instead of `lsc` maybe `ls -l` 

Functionality I want to add 
Adding projects as well as location.
A project would have a tag and split from location.
So a location would have "@home" and it would list all things @home
but different projects @home
like:

finish painting room @home +paint
make sure to wash paint off brushes @home +paint

clean fridge @home +cleaning
wash dishes @home +cleaning

That way I could further parse out tasks @home into their own project

But I wouldn't need to give something it's own project if it's a one off task

I'm thinking learning Cobra flags will be good with this..

Implementing this with raw SQL as well versus GORM..

Additionally:
convert priority to ! - if it begins with ! then it is a high priority and should be printed first 
convert + to project instead of priority
list on project as well as location
list on project and location
due date? porentially say how many days from now that is
update todo
delete todo
undo todo
list done items
 
possibly list out any text at all
